# HTTP endpoints

We have provide users and developers with an OpenAPI specification of our http endpoints. You can find it in the root of our repository ([openapi.yaml](https://github.com/stack-rs/mitosis/blob/main/openapi.yaml)) or access it online [herer with raw format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stack-rs/mitosis/refs/heads/main/openapi.yaml).

You can just read the specification file to understand how to interact with our http endpoints, or you can use tools like [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or the online [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to interactively explore and test the API.
